""" #range in for loop
python range() function generates the immutable sequence of numbers starting from the given start integer to the stop integer. It is a built-in function that returns a range object consists of a series of integer numbers, which we can iterate using a for loop.

In Python, Using a for loop with range(), we can repeat an action a specific number of times. For example, letâ€™s see how to use the range() function of Python 3 to produce the first six numbers.

Example

# Generate numbers between 0 to 6
for i in range(6):
    print(i)

Output

0
1
2
3
4
